# Text-to-Speech Generation

A clean and minimal **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** web interface built for fast and simple voice generation using **Hugging Face Inference API**.
The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight UI where users can enter text, click a button, and instantly receive generated speech — without running heavy models locally, since most hosted TTS models on Hugging Face are paid or require higher resources.
